# Key repository for Rain Morehead

This repository serves as a trusted source for my signing and encryption keys. Please check that the commits to this repository are signed by me, and feel free to confirm by emailing me. 

Note that if you would like me to sign your key, I'm happy to do so provided that I know you and we meet to exchange signatures (or sign over video chat or something - just need to verify you're who you say when signing for you.)
